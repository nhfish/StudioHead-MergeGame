# StudioHead-MergeGame
My first Unity project.

## Economy & Shop UI

The `EconomyManager` now supports multiple currencies (`Money`, `Gems`, and `Tickets`).
Attach the new `CurrencyPanel` prefab or script to a UI canvas and assign three
`TextMeshProUGUI` fields to display these values. The panel listens for economy
changes and updates automatically.
